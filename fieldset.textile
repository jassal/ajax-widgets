The Fieldset object is basically a section for your form.  It logically groups together elements of your form.  Using the Intalio|AJAX Fieldset is quite easy.  You simply drop it onto the canvas.  It is rendered with a light gray border and a default *[Fields]* caption.  You can easily change the caption by setting the fieldset *Title* property.

h2. Field Object

The Intalio|AJAX Field object is a wrapper around the code GI input objects.  They are designed to be used within a Fieldset.  This is not required, however, and they work fine outside of a Fieldset, but you get some advanced functionality when used within a Fieldset.

The Intalio|AJAX Field object is bascially 6 objects in 1.  

# field label
# help image
# validation image
# validation text
# required indicator
# core input object

The help image is by default turned off.  To turn on the help image, simply set the *Help Image :: Tooltip* in the field properties.  Any non-empty value will cause the help image to be displayed.  When the user moves the mouse over the image, the text is displayed as a tooltip.

You can change both images by setting their respective *Image Path* properties to another file.

The validation message works in the same manner.  If the *Validation :: Text/HTML* is set to a non-empty value then it will be displayed.

The validation image and validation text will only be displayed if the core input object has its *Required* value set to *Required*.  As well, it must fail validation for the validation image and text to be displayed.  Once an input is valid the validation image and text will disappear.

If you wish to disable the validation image and text then set the *Validation :: Show* property to *No* on the field properties.

The required indicator is s small red asterisk displayed between the label and the input object.  Its automatically displayed whenever a field has at least one required input object.
