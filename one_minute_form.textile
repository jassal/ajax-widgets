The best way to learn about the widgets is to jump right in and experiment.  Creating a new Intalio|AJAX form within Designer is fast and easy.  

First, create a new project if you haven't already.  To do this, right click in the *Process Explorer* and choose *New :: Intalio|Designer Business Process Project*.  Enter your project name and click *Finish*.

Next, right click your new project and choose *New :: AJAX Form*.  Enter your form name and click *Finish*.  This will generate a new empty form for you to experiment with.  The form will actually not be completely empty.  It will have a default header along the top and an empty fieldset.  A fieldset is basically a form section.

The Intalio|AJAX custom widgets are implimented as a set of GI addins.  They will appear in your GI *Component Libraries* pallet under *Addins :: IntalioWodgets*.

Lets add some input elements.  Drag and Drop a *Text Input* object from the *Component Library* to the canvas.  Drop it inside the fieldset.  Do the same thing with a *Date Picker* and then a *Select* object.  Your form should now look like this.

It's probably good to rename the field labels.  The easiest way is to select the object in the *Component Hierarchy*, then change the *Label Test* property in the *Properties Editor* pallet.  For example, we could rename the text input label to *Name*.
