An Intalio|AJAX Fieldset is basically a section for your form.  It logically groups together elements.  Using the Intalio|AJAX Fieldset is quite easy.  You simply drop it onto the canvas and then drop other Intalio|AJAX input widgets inside.  It's rendered with a light gray border and a default *[Fields]* caption.  You can easily change the caption by setting the fieldset *Title* property.

You can also set the *CSS Class* property if you wish to change the look of the fieldset.  You can add your own CSS file or edit the existing file @css/style.css@.

h2. Field Object

The Intalio|AJAX *Field* object is a wrapper around the core GI input objects.  They are designed to be used within a Fieldset.  This is not required, however, and they work fine outside of a Fieldset, but you get some advanced functionality when used within a Fieldset.

The Intalio|AJAX Field object is bascially 6 objects in 1.  

# field label
# help image
# validation image
# validation text
# required indicator
# core input object

The help image is by default turned off.  To turn on the help image, simply set the *Help Image :: Tooltip* in the field properties.  Any non-empty value will cause the help image to be displayed.  When the user mouses over the image, the text is displayed as a tooltip.

The validation message works in the same manner.  If the *Validation :: Text/HTML* is set to a non-empty value then it will be displayed.

The validation image and validation text will only be displayed if the core input object has its *Required* value set to *Required*.  As well, it must fail validation for the validation image and text to be displayed.  Once an input is valid the validation image and text will disappear.

The validation is done in real-time.  For instance, for a text input the input is validated with each change to the input such as when a user enters a key stroke.  These are handled with events that are automatically added for you.

If you wish to disable the validation image and text then set the *Validation :: Show* property to *No* on the field properties.

The required indicator is a red asterisk displayed between the label and the input object.  It's automatically displayed whenever a field has at least one required input object.

h2. Using Field Objects

Intalio|AJAX Field objects are used by simply dragging and dropping the Intalio|AJAX input widgets into a Fieldset.  The input widgets are objects such as Checkbox, Color Picker, Date Picker, Matrix Table, Radio Button, Select, Text Input, etc...  Be sure to use the Intalio version of these widgets and not the GI core input objects.

Each time you drop one of these Intalio|AJAX input widgets onto the canvas, you are actually dropping a Field object.  Please see "Intelligent Drag and Drop":drag_drop.html for more information on this functionality.
