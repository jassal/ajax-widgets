Copy the ajax-widgets directory into your GI workspace addins directory.  If you don't know your GI workspace location, you can find it by looking in your GI Builder settings by choosing Tools > IDE Settings... then select Paths.

For example, if your GI workspace is the following:

@C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Documents\TibcoGI@

Then copy the ajax-widgets to the following directory:

@C:\Documents and Settings\Mark\My Documents\TibcoGI\addins@

You will need to restart GI builder if it's currently open.
