title: XSD Based Form Generation
layout: default
---

Intalio Designer can use an existing XSD to automatically generate an Intalio|Ajax form.  The generated form will be a _*best try*_.  It may not always generate the perfect form you had in mind, but it should be a good starting point.

pre(xml-format). <xs:element name="Name">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element type="xs:string" name="first-name" minOccurs="0">
        <xs:annotation us:label="First name"/>
      </xs:element>
      <xs:element type="xs:string" name="last-name" minOccurs="0">
        <xs:annotation us:label="Last name"/>
      </xs:element>        
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

The above XSD snippet will generate the following form.  The @<annotation>@ elements are optional and are used to render the form label.  As you can see the rest of the schema is typical.  You can download this XSD "here (Name.xsd)":files/Name.xsd.

h2. Creating A Form From An Existing XSD

In order to generate the form from an existing schema, first, open up the schema in the *Process Explorer*.  Then right click the schema element that you would like to use as the basis as your form, then choose *New :: AJAX Form*.

This will open up the *New Ajax Form* wizard.  The defaults are typically good but you can customize to suit your needs.  The most important checkbox is the one entitled *Generate initial form from schema*.  This must be checked in order for the form to be created from the XSD.

If you wish you can choose a separate input and output schema.  If this option is chosen then the form will be generated based on the input schema.

h2. Annotations

The following XSD annotations are supported to assist in generating the form.

*(annotation)Annotation:* label
*(annotation)Purpose:* Sets the label for the field.
<pre id="xml-format">
<code>
<xs:element name="deliveryDate" type="xs:date">
  <xs:annotation us:label="Date" />
</xs:element>
</code>
</pre>

h2. GI Mappings

When the form is auto-generated from the schema, the initial GI mappings will be generated and saved as @rules/UserSchemaMapping.xml@.  You can double-click this file to edit the mappings if you wish.

*{color: red}Note:* If you add or remove fields to the form or rename fields, then you will need to make changes to the mapping file manually.  Currently Intalio|Ajax doesn't modify the mapping file automatically when the form is generated from a schema.
