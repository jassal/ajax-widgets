For all examples, please use the Intalio|AJAX widgets and not the core General Interface widgets.  The Intalio|AJAX widgets are located in the *Component Libraries* pallet under *Addins :: IntalioWidgets*.

When an Intalio|AJAX widget is dropped onto the canvas, it determines what is actually placed on the canvas.  This is best descibed in detail with an example.  If you drag and drop an Intalio|AJAX *Radio Button* object onto a Fieldset object, it will look like this.

This is what we call a Field object.  Please see "Fieldset and Field":fieldset_field.html for more details on the Field object.  It contains a label and some other useful properties for the input object, which in this case is a radio group of 2 buttons.

If you then drop another Intalio|AJAX *Radio Button* at this same location, it will simply add another radio button to this Field.

If you wish to create a new radio button Field then simply drop the radio button a little further down to an empty part of the canvas.

The key to remember is this.  If you drop an Intalio|AJAX input widget into an existing Field then it will add the core input object by itself.  If you drop it onto an empty part of the canvas then it will create a Field object, which will contain the core input object you are dropping.

You can also mix input types within the same Field object.  For instance, you can drop a *Date Picker* to create the initial Field object, then drop *Time Picker* onto the same Field to create the following.

h2. Adding Matrix Columns

Matrix columns work in a similar fashion.  To demonstrate this feature, first drop a Intalio|AJAX *Matrix Table* object to the canvas.

Next, drop a Intalio|AJAX *Text Input* object onto the matrix.  It will automatically add a new columnm to the matrix as a text input column.

*(note)Note:* Certain input objects cannot be easily added to a matrix, such as the *Color Picker* and *Slider*.  Also be aware that the default width of the matrix may need to be expanded if you add several columns.

h2. Layout Direction

By default when more than one input object is within the same field, the layout is generally horizontal.  That is, they will be added going across.  If you prefer vertical layout, then select the field object and choose *Vertical* for the *Layout :: Direction* property.

*(note)Note:* Radio buttons and checkboxes have their layout direction automatically set to vertical by default.  This can be easily changed in the same manner by adjusting the layout property so they flow horizontally.
