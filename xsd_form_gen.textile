title: XSD Based Form Generation
layout: default

If you have an existing XSD, Intalio Designer can use this XSD to automatically
generate a form.  The generated form will be a "best try".  It may not always 
generate the perfect form you had in mind. But most of the time it will be a 
good starting point.
