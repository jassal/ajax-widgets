title: Matrix Column Default Values
layout: default
---

A *Default Value* property has been added to the @jsx.gui.Matrix.Column@ property sheet.  When this property is set, it will cause that vaue to be used if a user does not enter a value for that column.

*(note)Note:* this only occurs when adding a new row to a matrix.  The user is responsible for any edits made to the data beyond this point.

Also, the *Att Name* property for a column should exist and be unique for default values to work.

h2. TimePicker

The default value for a time picker should be in the format *h:m:s* or *h:m*.  The hour, minute, and optional seconds can be one or two digits.  Milliseconds cannot be used.

h2. DatePicker

The default value for a date picker should be in the same format as the value in the format handler property.  A format handler must be specified.  For instance, the default format handler is *yyyy-MM-dd*.  For this a default value such as *2008-10-31* would be valid.

h2. CheckBox

The default value for a checkbox can be set with either *true or false* or *1 or 0*.  Actually, any value that is not *true* or *1* will be considered false.
