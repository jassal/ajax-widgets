General Interface provides built-in logging functionality.  When a form is loaded a pop-up window is opened where all logging data will be sent.  This can be extremely helpful in debugging and testing, but is typically not used in production.  

Logging is turned off by default.  To enable logging you or your administrator will need to modify the @logger.xml@ file.  This file is located within your server installation directory at this location:

@webapps/gi/files/logger.xml@

h2. Important Notes

Changes to @logger.xml@ are server-wide.  This file effects all Intalio|AJAX applications. 

This file is cached by your web browser.  You will probably need to reload, refresh, or clear your browser's cache before the changes take effect.

It's also worth noting that this logging is not written to any file.  The logging only exists in the browser pop-up window.

h2. Using Logging In Your Application

The simplest way to use logging is to use the jsx3.log() method.

var str = "ok";
jsx3.log("str = " + str);
