Required Input Fields

There are 3 possible stages of validation.  The initial stage begins if a form input is set to Required.  This will typically cause the field to visually indicate to the user that the field is not optional.  As the user edits an input the validation display may change to indicate the input is valid or not.

When a matrix column input is marked required, this causes 2 things to happen.  First, it forces an xml node to always be genereated for that data cell.  Second, some value must exist in the data cell or the form will not validate. 

Automatic Client Side Validation

If the user tries to submit a form that is incomplete, the form will notify the user with a javascript popup that fields are incomplete.  This happens automatically when any field is required on a form.  If no fields are required then no form validation will be done.

Server Side Validation

The last stage is server side schema validation.  This is more of a security measure.  When data is received by the server its validated against the schema to ensure it contains the appropriate data.  It's possible to add restrictions and annotations to the schema so that the form data is further restricted and validated.
