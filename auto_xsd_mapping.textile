title: Automatic XSD and GI Mapping
layout: default
---

The following does not apply to a form generated from an XSD.  When a form is generated from an XSD, then the user is responsible for the GI mappings.

Other than that restriction, when a form is created, the schema and GI mappings will be automatically created by Intalio|Designer.  This is done at build time.
