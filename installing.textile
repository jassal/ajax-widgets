The Intalio|Ajax Widgets are designed to be used within Tibco's General 
Interface Builder.  If you don't have GI Builder you can download it from 
"their website":http://www.tibco.com/devnet/gi/.

h2. Installing the Widgets

After you download and unzip the widgets you will have a directory named 
@intalio-ajax-widgets@.  To install the widgets you simply copy the 
@intalio-ajax-widgets@ directory into your GI workspace @addins@ 
directory.

If you don't know your GI workspace directory, you can find it by looking at 
your GI Builder settings, choose *Tools > IDE Settings...* then select *Paths*.

For example, if your GI workspace is the following:

@C:\TibcoGI@

Copy *intalio-ajax-widgets* into the following directory:

@C:\TibcoGI\addins@

Once copied the widgets would reside in the following directory:

@C:\TibcoGI\addins\intalio-ajax-widgets@

h2. Enabling the Widgets

If you just installed the widgets and GI builder is currently open, then close 
GI Builder first.

Launch GI Builder then open the project menu, *Project > Project Settings...* 
then select *Add-ins*.  Check the checkbox to the left of the *Intalio Widgets* 
row, then click *Save*.  

You will need to restart GI Builder for the change to take effect.

After restarting GI Builder, the Intalio|AJAX Widgets should be available under 
the *Addins* node in the *Component Libraries* pallet.
