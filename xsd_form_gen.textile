title: XSD Based Form Generation
layout: default
---

Intalio Designer can use an existing XSD to automatically generate an 
Intalio|Ajax form.  The generated form will be a _*best try*_.  It may not 
always generate the perfect form you had in mind, but most of the time it will 
be a good starting point.

Here's a simple XSD snippit and the resulting form.

pre(xsd-form-gen). <xs:element name="Name">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element type="xs:string" name="first-name" minOccurs="0">
        <xs:annotation us:label="First name"/>
      </xs:element>
      <xs:element type="xs:string" name="last-name" minOccurs="0">
        <xs:annotation us:label="Last name"/>
      </xs:element>        
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

The @<annotation>@ element is optional and is used to render the form label.  
As you can see the rest of the schema is typical.

In order to generate the form from an existing schema, first, open up the 
schema in the *Process Explorer*.  Then right click the schema element that you
would like to use as the basis as your form, then choose *New :: AJAX Form*.
