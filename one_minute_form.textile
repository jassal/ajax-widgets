Creating a new Intalio|AJAX form within Designer is fast and easy.  The best way to learn about the widgets is to jump right in and experiment.

First, create a new project if you haven't already.  To do this, right click in the *Process Explorer* and choose *New :: Intalio|Designer Business Process Project*.  Enter your project name and click *Finish*.

Next, right click your new project and choose *New :: AJAX Form*.  Enter your form name and click *Finish*.  This will generate a new empty form for you to experiment with.  The form will actually not be completely empty.  It will have a default header and an empty fieldset.  A fieldset is basically a form section.

The Intalio|AJAX custom widgets are implimented as a set of GI addins.  They will appear in your *Component Libraries* pallet under *Addins :: IntalioWidgets*.

Lets add some input elements.  Drag and Drop a *Text Input* object from the *Component Library* to the canvas.  Drop it inside the fieldset.  Do the same thing with a *Date Picker* and then a *Select* object.  Your form should now look like this.

It's probably good to rename the field labels.  The easiest way is to select the object in the *Component Hierarchy*, then change the *Label Text* property in the *Properties Editor* pallet.  For example, we could rename the *textinput-field* label to *Name*.

Next, change the *Label Text* property for the date picker to something like *Departure date* and the label for the select to *Vehicle*.  You can then continue to customize the form such as marking inputs as required, and setting the form header and fieldset labels to something more appropriate.

This is a simple form but shows the basics of using the Intalio|AJAX custom widgets.
