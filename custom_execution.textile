Intalio|AJAX is based on General Interface, so any custom Javascript you create can easily be added to your application.  But once your application is deployed the form submit buttons are automatically added by the server.

To allow you to add custom code before the form is submitted we have created the following hooks.

|_. Action|_. Function Name|
|Start|@window.intalioPreStart()@|
|Save|@window.intalioPreSave()@|
|Dismiss|@window.intalioPreDismiss()@|
|Claim|@window.intalioPreClaim()@|
|Revoke|@window.intalioPreRevoke()@|
|Complete|@window.intalioPreComplete()@|

One use of this would be to call a webservice just before the form is submitted.  Then continue or cancel the form submition depending on the results of the web service call.

As a simple example, the following would open an alert just before someone starts a process.

If your function returns a non-null value then that value will be used to generate an error message and the form will not be submitted.  This allows you to conditionally cancel the form submission in case of a problem.

When your function returns nothing or returns null, then the form will be submitted normally.
