title: Field Roles
layout: default

A Field can be assigned a comma separated list of roles.  This can aid, for example, in determining if the given field should be visible or not based on a user's role.

Here's an example of hiding a field based on role.

pre. var role = "employee";
var valid = field.isValidRole(role);
if (!valid) {
    field.setDisplay(jsx3.gui.Block.DISPLAYNONE, true);
}
